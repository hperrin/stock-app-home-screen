# Usage

As much as legally possible, I'm placing this in the public domain. You are allowed to do anything you want with this code, subject to the terms of the libraries its built with and any trademarks or copyrights thereof.

1. On an iPhone in Safari, go here: https://hperrin.github.io/stock-app-home-screen/
2. Click the Share button.
3. Click "Add to Home Screen".
4. Put in a name and add the shortcut to your home screen.
5. Launch it from the new shortcut on your home screen to get the fullscreen view.
6. You're ready to take stock photos with your phone.

- Click an app in the grid to move it right.
- Click the Phone app to remove an app from the end of the grid.
- Click the Messages app to add an app to the end of the grid (there are even some more apps that aren't shown by default).
- Click the Settings app to switch to the empty page (hide the apps in the grid).
- Click the Camera app to turn off the app move feature (so you can click apps without them moving).

# Running the App

```
npm run dev -- --host
```

Then visit the app on your iPhone, click share, add it to your home screen, then open it from there. You can now take stock photos of your phone without any trademarked app names or icons.
