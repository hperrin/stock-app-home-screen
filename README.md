# Stock App Home Screen

A "home screen" full of fake apps to use for stock photos.

<div align="center">
  <img src="static/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" height="600" width="auto" />
</div>

# Usage

1. On an iPhone in Safari, go here: https://hperrin.github.io/stock-app-home-screen/
2. Click the Share button.
3. Click "Add to Home Screen".
4. Put in a name and add the shortcut to your home screen.
5. Launch it from the new shortcut on your home screen to get the fullscreen view.
6. You're ready to take stock photos of your phone without any trademarked app names or icons.

- Click an app in the grid to move it right.
- Click the Phone app to remove an app from the end of the grid.
- Click the Messages app to add an app to the end of the grid (there are even some more apps that aren't shown by default).
- Click the Settings app to switch to the empty page (hide the apps in the grid).
- Click the Camera app to turn off the app move feature (so you can click apps without them moving).

# Just Want the Wallpaper?

It's build with CSS, but there are <a href="static/wallpaper">lots of renderings</a> I've done and made available.

# Running the App

If you want to make any changes, like adding your own app into the grid, you can clone the repo and run the app locally.

```
npm run dev -- --host
```

Then visit the app on your iPhone (on the same network), and follow the rest of the instructions from above.
